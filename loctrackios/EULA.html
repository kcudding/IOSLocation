Agreement.</p>
<h1 id="indemnification">Indemnification</h1>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold the Company and its parents,
subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and
licensors (if any) harmless from any claim or demand, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees, due to or arising out of your: (a) use of
the Application; (b) violation of this Agreement or any law or
regulation; or (c) violation of any right of a third party.</p>
<h1 id="no-warranties">No Warranties</h1>
<p>The Application is provided to You “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” and
with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum
extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf
and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors
and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether
express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
Application, including all implied warranties of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and
warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of
performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
representation of any kind that the Application will meet your
requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with
any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without
interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error
free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
company’s provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
Application, or the information, content, and materials or products
included thereon; (ii) that the Application will be uninterrupted or
error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any
information or content provided through the Application; or (iv) that
the Application, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on
behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses,
worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer,
so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this
section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under
applicable law. To the extent any warranty exists under law that cannot
be disclaimed, the Company, not the Application Store, shall be solely
responsible for such warranty.</p>
<h1 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of Liability</h1>
<p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire
liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of
this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall
be limited to the amount actually paid by You for the Application or
through the Application or 100 USD if You haven’t purchased anything
through the Application.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability
to use the Application, third-party software and/or third-party hardware
used with the Application, or otherwise in connection with any provision
of this Agreement), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised
of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
essential purpose.</p>
<p>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
exclusion may not apply to You.</p>
<p>You expressly understand and agree that the Application Store, its
subsidiaries and affiliates, and its licensors shall not be liable to
You under any theory of liability for any direct, indirect, incidental,
special consequential or exemplary damages that may be incurred by You,
including any loss of data, whether or not the Application Store or its
representatives have been advised of or should have been aware of the
possibility of any such losses arising.</p>
<h1 id="severability-and-waiver">Severability and Waiver</h1>
<h2 id="severability">Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or
invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish
the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force
and effect.</p>
<h2 id="waiver">Waiver</h2>
<p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to
require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not
effect a party’s ability to exercise such right or require such
performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach
constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
<h1 id="product-claims">Product Claims</h1>
<p>The Company does not make any warranties concerning the Application.
To the extent You have any claim arising from or relating to your use of
the Application, the Company, not the Application Store, is responsible
for addressing any such claims, which may include, but not limited to:
(i) any product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Application
fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and
(iii) any claim arising under consumer protection, or similar
legislation.</p>
<h1 id="united-states-legal-compliance">United States Legal
Compliance</h1>
<p>You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country
that is subject to the United States government embargo, or that has
been designated by the United States government as a “terrorist
supporting” country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States
government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>
<h1 id="changes-to-this-agreement">Changes to this Agreement</h1>
<p>The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or
replace this Agreement at any time. If a revision is material we will
provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
What constitutes a material change will be determined at the sole
discretion of the Company.</p>
<p>By continuing to access or use the Application after any revisions
become effective, You agree to be bound by the revised terms. If You do
not agree to the new terms, You are no longer authorized to use the
Application.</p>
<h1 id="governing-law">Governing Law</h1>
<p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall
govern this Agreement and your use of the Application. Your use of the
Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or
international laws.</p>
<h1 id="entire-agreement">Entire Agreement</h1>
<p>The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and the
Company regarding your use of the Application and supersedes all prior
and contemporaneous written or oral agreements between You and the
Company.</p>
<p>You may be subject to additional terms and conditions that apply when
You use or purchase other Company’s services, which the Company will
provide to You at the time of such use or purchase.</p>
